"""Feature Mapper (AI placeholder).

Provides an interface for future AI-based mapping between Original XML features
and other sources (DABAG, Web, etc.). Currently returns placeholders.

Expected input and output structures are intentionally simple:
- Input:  List[{"fname": str, "fvalue": str, "funit": str|None}]
- Output: List[{"fname": str, "fvalue": str, "funit": str|None}]

Future enhancements may include:
- Semantic similarity matching and canonicalization of feature names
- Unit conversion and normalization logic
- Confidence scores and rationale traces
- Model/backend selection via configuration
